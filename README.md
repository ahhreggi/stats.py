<b>stats.py</b> is a supplementary module to the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html">statistics</a> Python library, containing additional tools for numerical statistical calculations.

I wrote this when I was taking a statistics course in my second year and needed a solution to the highly repetitive, number-crunching homework. I realized that existing modules didn't quite have everything I needed and writing this would ensure my own understanding of the formulas.

<b>statscalc.py</b> utilizes this module by prompting for data values and then displaying a handy reference list with all of the calculations. :^)
